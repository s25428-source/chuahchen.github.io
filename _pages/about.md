About Me

Hello! My name is Chuah Chen, and I'm a 13-year-old programming enthusiast. I have a passion for coding and technology that has fueled my journey into the world of programming and cybersecurity. My curiosity for how things work drives me to learn new concepts and skills every day, with a strong focus on both practical and theoretical knowledge.

I’m also an avid badminton player, and in my free time, I enjoy challenging myself academically. My studies are very important to me, and I’ve earned straight A’s with mostly perfect scores (100s) in all of my subjects.

Skills
Programming Languages:

Python: I’ve used Python extensively for various projects, including automation, data analysis, and web scraping.

C#: I have experience building desktop applications and simple games using C# and Unity.

CSS: I’ve worked on web design and development, creating clean, responsive layouts for websites.

Cybersecurity:

Penetration Testing: At the age of 9, I started learning about cybersecurity and began testing large companies for security vulnerabilities. My passion for ethical hacking has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in security practices and ethical hacking.

Tools & Techniques: Familiar with tools such as Wireshark, Burp Suite, and Kali Linux. I understand the importance of maintaining digital privacy and security for individuals and organizations alike.

Notable Achievements

Penetration Testing Experience: Started working as a pen tester at the age of 9, helping large companies identify and fix vulnerabilities in their systems. This experience helped me develop a deep understanding of cybersecurity practices and the ethical responsibilities that come with it.

Academic Excellence: Consistently achieving 100s in all subjects shows my commitment to learning. My focus on both my academic studies and extracurricular activities has taught me time management, discipline, and perseverance.

Projects
1. Automated Web Scraper in Python

I built an automated web scraper in Python that collects data from websites and stores it in a structured format for further analysis. This project helped me learn more about APIs, requests, and data manipulation.

2. Basic C# Game (Unity)

Created a simple 2D game using Unity and C#. The game involved basic player movement, scoring, and game-over mechanics. This project helped me strengthen my object-oriented programming skills and understand game development principles.

3. Security Analysis Report for a Client

As part of my cybersecurity experience, I worked on identifying vulnerabilities in a client's system and created a detailed report outlining my findings. This experience sharpened my skills in penetration testing, reporting, and providing actionable advice to clients.

Hobbies and Interests

Badminton: I play badminton regularly and have competed in several local tournaments. It's a great way for me to stay active and improve my focus and reflexes.

Studying: I love learning new things, whether it’s academic subjects, coding languages, or the latest tech trends. I spend a lot of my free time researching and expanding my knowledge.
